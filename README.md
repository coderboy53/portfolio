# A revamp of my portfolio website

Why? I had to move ahead with learning. And the old one was a bit rashly put together using bootcamps and googling and stackoverflow. This one I want to build from scratch properly, with proper documentation and workflow so that it doesn't appear to be an alien mess later on.

## The techs?

I'll be using the same tech stack of React, but this time with the sole focus of building with React, rather than converting from HTML+CSS to react, which eliminates the twisted, complicated code which is a result of "how to convert this to this?" googling.

## The design?

I'll be experimenting with it, but mostly add a little technical, straighforward, minimalist-ish design and get rid of the old pretty design. I'll also make it for both light and dark mode. (Can't get rid of dark mode)

## You wanna try it locally?

Just clone the repo and run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Note: since we have used vitejs to create this react app, we are using the above, dont use ```npm start``` from create-react-app!
